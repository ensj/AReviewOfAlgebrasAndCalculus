This is a series of lecture notes to-be-updated continuously for you, the reader. As the text assumes some knowledge of algebra and calculus, it will instead focus more so on review of the material and in-depth approach to their concepts. 

The book may skip several topics deemed unimportant to review depending on your knowledge and background as an accounting major. However, if you wish to learn more about a given topic, feel free to ask. A section will be added when appropriate and you will be shortly notified once completed. 

As this is the first time I'm writing a lengthy piece of educational purposes, a lot of topics may seem scattered and confusing. Sometimes a section might be way too confusing to understand. I would love to have a remedy for this, but I don't. Just as I have to deal with you, you will have to deal with me. 

Just kidding, message me and we can talk about it.

The exercises are important, do them.

\chapter{The Algebras}
\epigraph{A lot of times, when kids have problems with algebra or trigonometry, it has nothing to do with the subject matter, has nothing to do with their innate intelligence. It's just they that they had some gaps in elementary school that they never got to fill in.}{Sal Khan}

Why do we care about Algebra? Perhaps the question isn't too difficult for you, given your accounting background. Algebra is the backbone of mathematics, and it's what gets used to solve countless numerical problems that require logic. Any time you need to know the solution of an equation, or when you need to consider the behaviors and the quantities of these solutions, Algebra is what gets used to uncover these mysteries. 

So in this chapter, we'll explore some of the ways this beautiful subject gets used in real life. Hopefully the examples will be able to motivate your studies as an accountant.

\section{Systems of Equations}

One could probably argue that humans are a creature of relationships. A large part of our lives are dedicated to maintaining, creating, and getting rid of relationships. Thus, finding solutions to problems regarding such relationships is of utmost importance to many of us. This is absolutely true for mathematicians as well.

As a matter of fact, what would a person do if they ended up having to find a solution to a problem regarding a set of interconnected relationships? This seems like a difficult problem to solve. It might be simple if they were dealing with one or two relationships, but as soon as this scales to, say, ten or twenty, it quickly gets out of hand. Thankfully, our team of mathematicians have been very hard at work, and they believe they reached a good solution. 

If the set of relationships mentioned happened to be a series of linear equations (it very often is), then we have something called a \textit{System of Linear Equations}. This here is a system of relationships that our mathematicians have managed to completely characterized. Given a system of any linear equations, we can see whether or not it has a unique solution, no solution, or even infinitely many solutions! This section will explore how we can find such solutions.

\subsection{Introduction to System of Linear Equations}

Before we go anywhere with this idea, we must first discuss what a linear equation even is. You might remember from oh-so-long-ago that a linear equation might be a simple equation for a line. In the two-dimensional case where we just deal with x and y, this is true. But if we extend out to the third dimension, we see that an equation of a plane is a linear equation as well.

So what is a linear equation, then?

\begin{definition}
  A \textit{linear equation} is an equation that may be put in the form 
  \begin{align*}
    a_0x_0 + a_1x_1 + \dots + a_nx_n + b = 0
  \end{align*}
  where the $a_i$ and $b$ are real constants, and $x_i$ are variables.
\end{definition}

Below are some examples of linear equations. Notice how the first three of the examples are all actually the same equations in different forms.

\begin{example}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $y = 2(x + 5)$
    \item $y - 2x = 10$
    \item $y -2x -10 = 0$
    \item $x + 5 = 0$
    \item $x + y + z = 0$
    \item $2x_0 + 3x_1 + 4x_2 + 5 = 0$
    \item $x + z = 10$
    \item $10x_0 + x_3 = 2$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

A system of linear equations is when there are more than one of such linear equations in a set. Below is an example of such a system.

\begin{example}
  \[
    \begin{cases}
      x + y = 2\\
      2x + 3y = 5
    \end{cases}
  \]
\end{example}

A principal interest concerning these systems of equations is to find a common solution satisfying all of these linear equations. For example, the solution to the above system would be the pair $x = 1, y = 1$. 

It's essential to note here that you don't always have a unique solution like we did here for a system of equations. As a matter of fact, it's a pretty special thing for a system of equations to have a unique solution. Here are two trivial systems where one has no solutions, and the other has infinitely many solutions. I won't yet spoil which is which, but you are encouraged to think about what might be the correct answer. 

\begin{example}
  \[
    \begin{cases}
      x + y = 0\\
      x + y = 0
    \end{cases}
  \]
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  \[
    \begin{cases}
      x + y = 0\\
      x + y = 5
    \end{cases}
  \]
\end{example}

It would be nice if there was an algorithm we could work through in order to always find the solution(s) to any given system of equations. Well, you'll be elated to learn that our mathematicians have been very hard at work, and managed to come up with an algorithm just in time. But before we get there, we'll need to build some intuition by exploring different methods of finding the solutions to linear equations. 

\subsection{Solving by Graphing}

Barring the odd stuff like abstract and futurist art, it's often visual beauty that speaks out to us most vividly. Things aren't so different in mathematics. It's the visual proofs that makes the most intuitive sense to us. So, we shall start off our solution-finding journey from a geometric viewpoint.

So long as we are working in up to three variables, we can graph any equation. Given a one-variable equation such as $x = 5$, we see that this is just a point in a line. In fact, we intuitively see that this point, 5, is the solution to our equation. Given a two-variable equation like $-x + y = 6$, we may simply rearrange this equation to $y = x + 6$. We have put the equation in its point-intercept form. Upon graphing we see that every point in the line satisfies our two-variable equation.

Three-variable equations are a tiny bit trickier. Take $x + y + z = 2$ for an example. You probably won't recognize this, but this is an equation for a \textit{plane} in three dimensional space. Then, we can conclude that every point belonging to the plane is a solution just as before with the two-variable equation. Upon going beyond with four, five variables, however, we lose the ability to nudge out a geometric solution for our equations. We simply aren't capable of graphing in four or more dimensions. You are more than welcome to try, however, if you feel like you have what it takes.

In any case, let us come back to the topic of a system of equations. Given a system, we can simply graph every equation inside. Finding a common solution to our system is as simple as looking for a common point of intersection between all of our equations. Behold the following example.

\begin{example}
  \[
    \begin{cases}
      x + 4y = 2\\
      2x + 3y = 5
    \end{cases}
  \]
\end{example}

Below, the graph drawn in blue will represent the equation $2x + 3y = 5$. The graph in red is $x + 4y = 2$. 

\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=7cm]{system-of-eqs.png}
  \centering
  \caption{Graph of a system of equations}
\end{figure}

We can see that there exists a solution where $x=2.8$ and $y = -0.2$. Very cool. Let's try a different example now, where we take the previous system and add a new, third equation onto it. 

\begin{example}
  \[
    \begin{cases}
      x + 4y = 2\\
      2x + 3y = 5\\
      2x + 3y = 4
    \end{cases}
  \]
\end{example}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=7cm]{system-of-eqs(2).png}
  \centering
  \caption{Graph of a system of equations}
\end{figure}

Uh-oh. Now there's a problem. We can't find a common point of intersection between the three equations. This means that there isn't a single value of $x$ and $y$ that satisfies all three equations in the example. A situation like this is known as the system having \textbf{no solutions}.

Now, as I'm editing this book about three weeks after I first wrote this chapter, I'm starting to realize that I really don't want to open up desmos to create another visual example. We'll instead describe a very simple situation where a system will have an infinite number of solutions and call it a day. 

Consider the following system of two equations.

\begin{example}
  \[
    \begin{cases}
      x = y\\
      x = y
    \end{cases}
  \]
\end{example}

You'll notice (quite quickly, I'd hope) that the following system has two equivalent equations. What does that mean?

Well, if you try graphing the two equations, you'll notice that you'd end up drawing two lines right over each other. Thus, if you select any point within one equation, that point will also belong to the other equation. This means that there are an infinite number of points of intersection within this system, otherwise known as the system having \textbf{infinite solutions}.

Note that two equations don't necessarily have to be the same in order for them to have an infinite number of solutions! This may be true in the two-dimensional case, but it quickly falls apart in three-dimensions. Consider the case where you draw two different, intersecting planes in three dimensions. When you intersect two planes, will you always end up with one point of intersection? 

The answer is a resounding no. If you're curious why, you are encouraged to take a piece of paper and try folding it by half. Now, imagining each folded section of your paper as a separate plane, you'll note that the intersection between your two planes will always be a singular line no matter how you fold your paper. A line contains an infinite number of points, so we see that two intersecting planes will always have an infinite number of solutions.

As a matter of fact, a three variable system will always need at least three equations in order for it to have a unique solution. This is in fact true for any n-variable system of equations.  

In any case, the geometric method of solving systems of equations is by far the most straightforward and easy to understand. But as hinted before, the geometry of all this falls apart as soon as we use more than three variables. Here is where we decide to pull out the big guns: algebra. 

\subsection{Solving Through Elimination}

Recall that an equation is a statement asserting the \textbf{equality} of two equations. Thus our new method will very obviously have to take advantage of one of the properties of equality. Consider the following property. 

\begin{center}
  Given a, b, and c, if $a = b$, then $a + c = b + c$. If $c = d$, then $a + c = b + d$. 
\end{center}

We can apply this to our system of equations. Let's take a look at the system below. 

\[
  \begin{cases}
    x + 4y = 2\\
    2x + 3y = 5
  \end{cases}
\]

Let $a = 2x + 3y$, and $b = 5$. Then $c = x + 4y$ and $d = 2$. Then, our $a + c = b + d$ would be 

\begin{align*}
  3x + 7y = 7
\end{align*}

This is not very useful for our purpose. But what if we look at $a - c = b - d$?

\begin{align*}
  x - y = 3
\end{align*}

We can apply the process one more time to look at $a - 2c = b - 2d$. 

\begin{align*}
  - 5y = 1
\end{align*}

Then, with a little bit of algebraic manipulation, we see that $y = -\frac{1}{5}$. Substituting this value into $x + 4y = 2$, we see that $x - \frac{4}{5} = 2$ and $x = 2 + \frac{4}{5} = 2.8$. 

\textbf{tl;dr} So, going back to our initial system, we essentially took the first equation and subtracted it twice from the second equation in order to \textbf{eliminate} the $x$ variable. Of course, this process can be used to eliminate any variable(s) from an equation in a system. 

Let's now take a look at the system of equations that didn't have a solution from before.

\[
  \begin{cases}
    x + 4y = 2\\
    2x + 3y = 5\\
    2x + 3y = 4
  \end{cases}
\]

By subtracting the second equation from the third, we get:

\[
  \begin{cases}
    x + 4y = 2\\
    2x + 3y = 5\\
    0 = 1
  \end{cases}
\]

Now it's very evident that 0 does not equal 4. This means that there is an \textbf{inconsistency} in the system. When this happens, a solution cannot exist. Let's take a look at the modified version of this same problem.

\[
  \begin{cases}
    x + 4y = 2\\
    2x + 3y = 5\\
    2x + 3y = 5
  \end{cases}
\]

Then, again subtracting the second equation from the third equation: 

\[
  \begin{cases}
    x + 4y = 2\\
    2x + 3y = 5\\
    0 = 0
  \end{cases}
\]

This time we got $0=0$. This statement is true regardless of the values for $x$ and $y$. Thus, there are infinitely many solutions to this system of equations. 

\subsection{Word Problems}

In this subsection, we won't go over the strict strategy of analyzing word problems and solving them. I'll assume that you already know this, and will instead use an example from Eisner \cite{eisner:1994} to demonstrate the use case of system of equations.

Let's say say Steve held 100\% of stocks in a company at \$5000. The company decides to issue new stocks to Dave so that Dave would then own 5\% of the company. How much money would Dave's stocks be worth?

First we find the value for the new total value of outstanding stock.

\begin{align*}
  S = 5000 + x
\end{align*}

Where $S$ is the value of the outstanding stock, and $x$ is the stock issued to Dave. We also know that Dave's stock is worth 5\%. 

\begin{align*}
  x = 0.05S
\end{align*}

We now have a system of equations.

\[
  \begin{cases}
    S = 5000 + x\\
    x = 0.05S\\
  \end{cases}
\]

Rearranging the equations, we get the following.

\[
  \begin{cases}
    S - x = 5000\\
    -0.05S + x = 0\\
  \end{cases}
\]

Using our process of elimination, we simply add the bottom equation to the top to isolate $S$. 

\[
  \begin{cases}
    0.95S = 5000\\
    -0.05S + x = 0\\
  \end{cases}
\]

Then, $S = 5000 * \frac{1}{0.95} \approx 5263.16$, so Dave was awarded \$263.16 in total.  

\subsection{Problems}

For the next three problems, solve the given system of equations by graphing (you may use desmos). Indicate whether or not the system has solutions, no solutions, or infinite solutions.
