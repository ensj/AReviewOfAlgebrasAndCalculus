This is a series of lecture notes to-be-updated continuously for you, the reader. As the text assumes some knowledge of algebra and calculus, it will instead focus more so on review of the material and in-depth approach to their concepts. 

The book may skip several topics deemed unimportant to review depending on your knowledge and background as an accounting major. However, if you wish to learn more about a given topic, feel free to ask. A section will be added when appropriate and you will be shortly notified once completed. 

As this is the first time I'm writing a lengthy piece of educational purposes, a lot of topics may seem scattered and confusing. Sometimes a section might be way too confusing to understand. I would love to have a remedy for this, but I don't. Just as I have to deal with you, you will have to deal with me. 

Just kidding, message me and we can talk about it.

The exercises are important, do them.

\chapter{The Algebras}
\epigraph{A lot of times, when kids have problems with algebra or trigonometry, it has nothing to do with the subject matter, has nothing to do with their innate intelligence. It's just they that they had some gaps in elementary school that they never got to fill in.}{Sal Khan}

In this chapter we'll explore some basic algebra concepts. I trust that you know the most basic ones, such as linear equations and inequalities, so we'll work on the other non-trivial parts of algebra.

\section{Systems of Equations}

In this section, we'll cover how to solve systems of linear equations. We'll briefly cover solving a system by graphing, using substitution, and then we'll finally cover the general method of using elimination. The general method will uncover a linear algebra approach to solving these equations.

\subsection{Introduction to Systems of Equations}

If you remember, a \textit{linear equation} is an equation for a line. Here are some examples of linear equations.

\begin{example}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $y = 2(x + 5)$
    \item $y - 2x = 10$
    \item $y -2x -10 = 0$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

A system of linear equations is when there are more than one of such linear equations working together. Here is one such example.

\begin{example}
  \[
    \begin{cases}
      x + y = 2
      2x + 3y = 5
    \end{cases}
  \]
\end{example}

A principal interest concerning these systems of equations is to find a common solution satisfying all of these linear equations.
