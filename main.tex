This is a series of lecture notes to-be-updated continuously for you, the reader. As the text assumes some knowledge of algebra and calculus, it will instead focus more so on review of the material and in-depth approach to their concepts. 

The book may skip several topics deemed unimportant to review depending on your knowledge and background as an accounting major. However, if you wish to learn more about a given topic, feel free to ask. A section will be added when appropriate and you will be shortly notified once completed. 

As this is the first time I'm writing a lengthy piece of educational purposes, a lot of topics may seem scattered and confusing. Sometimes a section might be way too confusing to understand. I would love to have a remedy for this, but I don't. Just as I have to deal with you, you will have to deal with me. 

Just kidding, message me and we can talk about it.

The exercises are important, do them.
